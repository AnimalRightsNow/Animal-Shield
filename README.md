# Animal-Shield

Hi guys,
I am Johan Andersson from Sweden and am new to programming. I have a bachelor degree in finance, among
other things and is currently trying out ways to connect people who are devoted to animal right issues.
My main idea is to create a cryptocurrency, specifically directed to this very large group of people
all around the world, so that they in an easy way can allocate capital between each other, in the work
for a better world for the silent beings on four legs. It is not meant to be a regular speculative asset
but a practical tool in the everyday work for animal rights people and others surrounding them and 
supporting them.

I have named the currency, AnimalShield
